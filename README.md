**Contextual familiarity rescues the cost of switching**

Here are the scripts from this project which results in the manuscript "Contextual familiarity rescues the cost of switching." Data available upon request and all scripts for reproducing the main results shown in the manuscripts can be found here. 


**Experimental Design**

Experiment 1

The experiment consisted of eight blocks, each with encoding, distractor, and recall phases. During encoding, participants viewed a scene image for 1,000ms, followed by a 500ms blank screen and then a word for 2,500ms, during which they indicated whether the item described by the word fit the scene (yes/no). We manipulated scene-switching rates across three conditions: no switch (all items studied with the same scene), low switch (scene changed every four items), and high switch (scene changed every two items). Blocks included 24 items, and conditions were counterbalanced, with low or high switch rates always paired with no switch within a block. Participants were randomly assigned to Contextual Familiarity (switching between two repeated scenes) or a Contextual Novelty (switching to novel scenes each time), with all scenes randomized and unique to each block. After a brief math distractor, participants verbally recalled as many words as they could. 


Experiment 2

The procedure for Experiment 2 was identical to that of Experiment 1, except for the following changes aimed at improving participantsâ€™ verbal recall performance. First, we shortened the list length to only contain 16 items per list. Second, given that the lists were shorter, each switch rate (no switch, low switch, and high switch) was presented in its own block and there were 6 blocks total. Lastly, a minimum recall time was added to encourage participants to search their memory until the time was finished.
